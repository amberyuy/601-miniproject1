### dataset
- The dataset I used is from https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining, but I only use two of them,roses and sunflowers. 

### Implement
- first run flowertrain.py to train, you need to change the dataset's path, then run flowerpredict.py to test. I have already put the picture of accuracy in this folder.
